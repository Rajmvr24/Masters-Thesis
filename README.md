## About The Project

The Aim of the project is to propose and investigate a propagation model that is suitable for 5G New Radio implementation in Macro cell environments. By analyzing the different signal quality parameters like RSRP,RSRQ,SINR, the suitable propagation model can be selected. 
The following tasks are performed in order to achieve the Aim of the research project.

•	Initially, analyze the different existing propagation models sitable for 5G New Radio and operating frequency.

•	Analyze the 5G New Radio parameters(PCI, PSS, SSS, PBCH, DMRS) and signal quality parameters.(RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSSI).

•	Collect  the measurements of different parameters  near the base station .

•	Import these measured values into radio planning software and predict the values.

•	Perform the comparison of measured values and predicted values for different propagation models to find best suited model in macro cell environments.

•	Calibrate the proposed model by adjusting the correction coefficient.
